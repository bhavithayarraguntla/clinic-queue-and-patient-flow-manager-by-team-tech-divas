Clinic Queue & Patient Flow Manager
Project Overview
Clinic Queue & Patient Flow Manager is a web-based HealthTech application designed to improve patient flow and reduce waiting time confusion in clinics. Many small and medium clinics still rely on manual queues or basic token systems that do not prioritize patients based on urgency or appointment type.

This project provides a simple, privacy-first digital solution using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Problem Statement
Clinics face difficulties in managing patient queues efficiently, especially when handling emergency cases, appointments, and walk-in patients simultaneously. This leads to long waiting times, overcrowding, and poor patient experience.

Solution
The application introduces a rule-based queue management system that:

Prioritizes emergency patients
Handles appointments before walk-ins
Displays estimated waiting time
Improves transparency for patients and staff
Intended Users
